Are there fake gov TLDs in the wild?

After seeing the krebs article (https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/its-way-too-easy-to-get-a-gov-domain-name/) I wanted to try to get some info together to see if I could highlight vulnerable cities. The criteria being that they have a .us or a .com, but no .gov. For now I am just checking cityname.[us|gov|com]. No nicknames or short names or aliases (partly because that doesn't come with the free dataset I'm using). 

What do we do with this info?
For now I just want to check what exists and what doesn't. Haven't decided what to do beyond that. 

So far this work has included a list of city names from simplemaps, who say they'd like credit if the data is used for anything, check out license.txt if interested. I downloaded the free 'basic' data that they provide
